<h2>Powershell Fake Malware Generation</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>

In this project I demonstrate the generation of fake malware (harmless text files) in a Windows VM within Azure using a powershell script. The code generation triggers windows security and threat protection as it generates text files.


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Cloud Platform)
- Azure Virtual Machine 
- Powershell
- Remote Desktop Protocol (For connection to the VM with my local PC)

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows 10 Home (Local PC)

<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

In the video below, I demonstrate fake malware (text files) being generated by powershell. In doing so it triggered alerts by Windows security and gave the option to quarantine the said text files. Any code generation on a PC usually triggers a virus warning and is blocked by the PC or antivirus software. The events can then be viewed in the devices event logs.
